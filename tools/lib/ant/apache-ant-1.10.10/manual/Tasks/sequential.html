<h2>Sequential</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p><code>Sequential</code> is a container task&mdash;it can contain other Apache Ant tasks. The
nested tasks are simply executed in sequence. Sequential's primary use is to support the sequential
execution of a subset of tasks within the <a href="parallel.html">parallel</a> task</p>

<p>The <code>sequential</code> task has no attributes and does not support any nested elements apart
from Ant tasks. Any valid Ant task may be embedded within the sequential task.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>This example shows how the <code>sequential</code> task is used to execute three tasks in
sequence, while another task is being executed in a separate thread.</p>
<pre>
&lt;parallel&gt;
  &lt;wlrun ... &gt;
  &lt;sequential&gt;
    &lt;sleep seconds=&quot;30&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;junit ... &gt;
    &lt;wlstop/&gt;
  &lt;/sequential&gt;
&lt;/parallel&gt;</pre>
