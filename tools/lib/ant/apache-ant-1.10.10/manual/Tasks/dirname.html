<h2 id="echo">Dirname</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Task to determine the directory path of a specified file.</p>
<p>When this task executes, it will set the specified property to the value of the specified file
(or directory) up to, but not including, the last path element. If the specified file is a path that
ends in a filename, the filename will be dropped. If the specified file is just a filename, the
directory will be the current directory.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This is not the same as the UNIX <code>dirname</code> command, which is
defined as "strip non-directory suffix from filename". <code>&lt;dirname&gt;</code> determines the
full directory path of the specified file.</p>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<table class="attr">
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Attribute</th>
    <th scope="col">Description</th>
    <th scope="col">Required</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>file</td>
    <td>The path to take the dirname of.</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>property</td>
    <td>The name of the property to set.</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Set <code>antfile.dir</code> to the directory path for <samp>${ant.file}</samp>.</p>
<pre>&lt;dirname property=&quot;antfile.dir&quot; file=&quot;${ant.file}&quot;/&gt;</pre>

<p>Set <code>foo.dirname</code> to the project's <var>basedir</var>.</p>
<pre>&lt;dirname property=&quot;foo.dirname&quot; file=&quot;foo.txt&quot;/&gt;</pre>
