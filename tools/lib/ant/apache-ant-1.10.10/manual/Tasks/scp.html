<title>SCP Task</title>

<body>

<h2 id="scp">SCP</h2>
<p><em>Since Apache Ant 1.6</em></p>
<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Copies a file or FileSet to or from a (remote) machine running an SSH daemon.
FileSet <em>only</em> works for copying files from the local machine to a remote machine.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This task depends on external libraries not included in the Ant
distribution.  See <a href="../install.html#librarydependencies">Library Dependencies</a> for more
information.  This task has been tested with <code>jsch-0.1.2</code> and later.</p>

<p>See also the <a href="sshexec.html">sshexec task</a></p>

      form <samp>user[:password]@host:/directory/path</samp>.  <samp>:password</samp> can be omitted
      if you use key based authentication or specify the <var>password</var> attribute.  The way
      remote path is recognized is whether it contains <q>@</q> character or not. This will not work

<h3>Parameters specified as nested elements</h3>

<h4>resource collections</h4>
<p><a href="../Types/fileset.html">FileSet</a>s
or other <a href="../Types/resources.html#collection">resource collections</a> are used to select groups
of files to copy. To use a fileset or a resource collection, the <var>todir</var> attribute must be

<p>Prior to Ant 1.9.7 only <code>&lt;fileset&gt;</code> has been supported as a nested element.</p>

<p>Adds configuration settings for the JSch Session created that are
  not directly supported by specific Ant attributes.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Copy a single local file to a remote machine:</p>
<pre>&lt;scp file=&quot;myfile.txt&quot; todir=&quot;user:password@somehost:/home/chuck&quot;/&gt;</pre>

<p>Copy a single local file to a remote machine with separate <var>password</var>
attribute:</p>
<pre>&lt;scp file=&quot;myfile.txt&quot; todir=&quot;user@somehost:/home/chuck&quot; password=&quot;password&quot;/&gt;</pre>

<p>Copy a single local file to a remote machine using key base authentication:</p>
<pre>
&lt;scp file=&quot;myfile.txt&quot;
     todir=&quot;user@somehost:/home/chuck&quot;
     keyfile=&quot;${user.home}/.ssh/id_dsa&quot;
     passphrase=&quot;my extremely secret passphrase&quot;/&gt;</pre>

<p>Copy a single remote file to a local directory:</p>
<pre>&lt;scp file=&quot;user:password@somehost:/home/chuck/myfile.txt&quot; todir=&quot;../some/other/dir&quot;/&gt;</pre>

<p>Copy a remote directory to a local directory:</p>
<pre>&lt;scp file=&quot;user:password@somehost:/home/chuck/*&quot; todir=&quot;/home/sara&quot;/&gt;</pre>

<p>Copy a local directory to a remote directory:</p>
<pre>
&lt;scp todir=&quot;user:password@somehost:/home/chuck/&quot;&gt;
  &lt;fileset dir=&quot;src_dir&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/scp&gt;</pre>

<p>Copy a set of files to a directory:</p>
<pre>
&lt;scp todir=&quot;user:password@somehost:/home/chuck&quot;&gt;
  &lt;fileset dir=&quot;src_dir&quot;&gt;
    &lt;include name=&quot;**/*.java&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/fileset&gt;
&lt;/scp&gt;</pre>

<p>Copy a set of files to a remote directory in reverse last-modified order:</p>
<pre>
&lt;scp todir=&quot;user:password@somehost:/home/chuck&quot;&gt;
  &lt;sort&gt;
    &lt;reverse&gt;
      &lt;date/&gt;
    &lt;/reverse&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir=&quot;src_dir&quot;&gt;
      &lt;include name=&quot;**/*&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/fileset&gt;
  &lt;/sort&gt;
&lt;/scp&gt;</pre>

<p><strong>Security Note</strong>: Hardcoding passwords and/or usernames in <code>scp</code> task
can be a serious security hole.  Consider using variable substitution and include the password on
the command line.  For example:</p>
<pre>&lt;scp todir=&quot;${username}:${password}@host:/dir&quot; ...&gt;</pre>

<p>Invoking Ant with the following command line:</p>
<pre class="input">ant -Dusername=me -Dpassword=mypassword target1 target2</pre>
<p>is slightly better, but the username/password is exposed to all users on an Unix system (via
the <kbd>ps</kbd> command). The best approach is to use the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> task and/or
retrieve the password from a (secured) <samp>.properties</samp> file.</p>

<p><strong>Unix Note</strong>: File permissions are not retained when files are downloaded; they end
up with the default <code>UMASK</code> permissions instead. This is caused by the lack of any means
to query or set file permissions in the current Java runtimes. If you need a permission-preserving
copy function, use <code>&lt;exec executable="scp" ... &gt;</code> instead.</p>
