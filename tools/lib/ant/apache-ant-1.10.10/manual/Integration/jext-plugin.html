<p>You can download the plugin
at: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jext/files/OldFiles/antwork_plugin.zip/download"

<h2>Installation instructions from the Readme.txt</h2>

<p>You have to enable the Jext Console to see the Apache Ant output (menu:
Edit&rarr;Options&hellip;&ndash;General Panel), because Ant messages are redirected to the Jext
console.</p>

<p>You can configure the Ant call in the Jext menu: Edit&rarr;Options&hellip;&ndash; Plugin
Options&ndash;Antwork Plugin Panel; here you can set Ant home directory and the path to your build
file.</p>

<p>You can start AntWork in the menu: Plugins&rarr;Ant&rarr;Work Now!  In the appearing dialog box
you can enter the target which you want to compile.</p>

<p>If a <code>javac</code> error occurs in the Ant run, an error list opens within Jext. With a
double click on the error message you jump to the error in the specified Java source file.</p>
