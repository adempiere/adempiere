<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>This version:
http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231</p>
<p>This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on
December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright ownership
notice such that this license can be used with materials other than
those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the
W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the
license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this
version is the same as the <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/copyright-software-19980720">previous
version</a> and is written so as to preserve the <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses">
Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility</a> and
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/W3C.php">OSI's
certification</a> under the <a href=
