# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community an enjoyable experience for everyone.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other community members.
* Being respectful of differing opinions and viewpoints.
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing.
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of improper language or imagery.
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any inappropriate behavior.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
info@adempiere.io.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to act confidentially.

the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:
