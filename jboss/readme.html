AS 4.2.3.GA
Release Notes</h1>
<p>This is the 3rd&nbsp;bug fixing release of the <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/">JBoss Application
Server</a> v4.2 series.&nbsp;The aim of this release is to
provide fixes for&nbsp;bugs reported by the
community&nbsp;against previous JBossAS
v4.2.x releases.&nbsp;There were some backwards compatible <a href="#Libraries">component
upgrades</a> so switching to AS 4.2.3.GA from a previous
4.2.0/4.2.1/4.2.2 release should not present any problems. Please check
out&nbsp;the <a href="readme.html#Details">Detailed
Release Notes</a> section for the full details.</p>
<p>A secondary target for this release was to
improve&nbsp;support for Java 6. JBossAS 4.2.3.GA can be build with
both JDK5 <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span>JDK6.
The JDK5 compiled binaries have undergone more rigorous testing, they
constitute our certified version and can run under both Java 5
&amp; 6 VMs (with a few configuration changes for JDK6, see the
configuration section below). The JDK6 compiled binaries include
support for the JDBC 4 APIs, but this should be considered experimental
at this point.</p><p>JBoss AS 4.2
is a stepping stone from JBoss 4.0 to JBoss 5.0. It combines a lot (but
not all) of the exciting new features of JBoss 5, but based on the
stable 4.x MicroKernel architecture.</p>
<p>JBoss AS 4.2 is also used as the basis for the<a href="http://www.redhat.com/jboss/platforms/application/">
JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.</a> The <i>Application
Platform</i> bundles <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/">JBoss AS&nbsp;</a>and
<a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossseam/">JBoss Seam</a>&nbsp;
in a software package for which commercial support
is offered
by JBoss/Red Hat. Please read

JBoss AS 4.2
series</a></h2>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.jboss.org/portal/jbossejb3">JBoss
EJB3</a> is now deployed *by default* in JBossAS 4.2.x The fact
that we base on JDK5 makes our life easier in this regard, meaning we
don't have to maintain jdk5 code retro-weaved for jdk1.4 runtimes, and
we can include by default components that require jdk5 to run.</li><li><a href="http://www.jboss.com/products/jbossweb">JBoss
Web</a> v2.x is the web container in JBossAS 4.2, an
implementation based on Apache Tomcat that includes the Apache Portable
Runtime (APR) and Tomcat native technologies to achieve scalability and
performance characteristics that match and exceed the Apache Http
server. In the absence of the native libraries,
JBoss Web falls back to the standard non-native connector mode. The
native libraries need to be <a href="http://www.jboss.org/jbossweb/downloads">downloaded</a>
and installed separately in JBOSS_HOME/bin/native.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jboss.com/products/transactions">JBoss
Transactions</a> v4.2 is the default transaction manager for
JBossAS 4.2. JBoss Transactions is founded on industry proven
technology and 18 year history as a leader in distributed transactions,
and is one of the most interoperable implementations available. The JTA
version of JBoss Transactions included with the server provides for
fully recoverable transactions. For distributed transaction support the
JTS version of JBoss Transactions will need to be used. Furthermore, it
is always possible to fall back to the legacy JBossTM fast in-memory
transaction manager implementation, although it should be noted
that&nbsp;JBoss TM will not be supported in future JBossAS versions.</li>
<li><a href="http://labs.jboss.com/portal/jbossws">JBoss
WS</a>
is the web services stack for JBoss 4.2 providing Java EE compatible
web services.</li>
<li><a href="http://labs.jboss.com/portal/jgroups">JGroups</a>/<a href="http://www.jboss.org/products/jbosscache">JBossCache</a>
is already configured
to support channel multiplexing, when it becomes available.</li>
<li><a href="http://labs.jboss.com/jbossremoting/">JBoss
Remoting</a> was upgraded to the latest stable 2.2.x version.
This was done in order to align dependencies with the thirdparty
libraries required by the new <a href="http://labs.jboss.com/jbossmessaging/">JBoss Messaging</a>,
which means that, if you want, you can replace the default <a href="http://www.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=JBossMQ">JBossMQ</a>
messaging provider with JBoss Messaging, without having to revert to a
scoped deployment.</li>
</ul><!-- ======================================================= --><h2><a name="Compatibility">Compatibility
Issues</a></h2>
This lists the changes that could affect compatibility.<br>
<br>According to our <a href="http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=JBossProductVersioning">product
versioning rules</a>, JBossAS 4.2.3 should be fully compatible
with previous JBossAS 4.2.x releases. However you may want to check the
release notes of
the individual&nbsp;<a href="readme.html#Libraries">JBoss
and Thirdparty libraries</a> updated with this release. Some
related issues from previous JBoss releases that you should be aware of
are listed below:<br>
<h3>JBossAS 4.2.2.GA</h3><ul><li>JBossWS 1.2.1
supported JAX-WS only as
a technology preview while JBossWS&nbsp;2.0.1 used in AS 4.2.2
provides
full JAX-WS support. If you have used in your code
the&nbsp;annotation <span style="font-family: monospace;">org.jboss.ws.annotation.WebContext</span>&nbsp;this
must&nbsp;be&nbsp;replaced by <span style="font-family: monospace;">org.jboss.wsf.spi.annotation.WebContext.</span></li><li>JBoss
WS 1.0.x&nbsp;due to a deployer limitation used a proprietary .jse
extension&nbsp;for deploying WS endpoints&nbsp;nested in .sar
files.
This was deprecated with JBoss WS 1.2.x. and with JBoss WS 2.x this
proprietary extension is not supported anymore as it is possible to use
the standard&nbsp;.war extension for deploying nested WS endpoints.
If
you see:&nbsp;INIT_WAITING_DEPLOYER error messages for .jse files,
re-package them using a .war extension, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBWS-1854">JBWS-1854</a>.<span style="font-family: monospace;"></span></li><li>Another
known limitation is that&nbsp;EJB3 web service endpoints can only
be
specified using annotations and not metadata in jboss.xml. This is
something that will be addressed&nbsp;in a future release, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4852">JBAS-4852</a>,
<a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBWS-1813">JBWS-1813</a>.</li><li>Finding
the default local business interface on a ejb3 bean may not work in
certain inheritance scenarios. You may workaround this known
problem&nbsp;by&nbsp;annotating the local business interface.
Read more
about this at <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/EJBTHREE-1062">EJBTHREE-1062</a>.<span style="font-family: monospace;"><br></span></li><li>EJB
Timer
related fixes, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-3379">JBAS-3379</a>,
<a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4053">JBAS-4053</a>.</li><li>JBossMQ
related fixes, JBAS-4525, JBAS-4555, JBAS-4559, JBAS-4607, JBAS-4625,
JBAS-4699</li><li>JSP compiler now set to compile JDK 1.5
source code by default, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4605">JBAS-4605</a>.</li><li>The
mail-ra.rar resource adapter was missing from the distro, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4659">JBAS-4659</a>.</li><li>HSQLDB
(which shouldn't be used in production) v1.8.0.8 has a known bug when
used in server mode, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4694">JBAS-4694</a>.
This doesn't affect the default jboss installation where HSQLDB is used
in in-process mode.</li><li>Serialization
of HomeHandleImplIIOP has changed. In the unlikely case of a
compatibility problem, define the system property
-Dorg.jboss.proxy.ejb.old.homehandle.serialization=true to fall back to
the legacy serialization mode, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4801">JBAS-4801</a>.
</li></ul><h3>JBossAS
4.2.1.GA
</h3><ul><li>JBoss TS, the new default transaction
manager will not let
you enlist multiple 1-phase participants in the same transaction. This
was *not* the default behavior with the legacy JBoss TM that would log
a warning and continue. There are good reasons for this change, mainly
to avoid heuristic outcomes in the case of system crashes, which is the
primary reason of using a transaction manager anyway! If your come
across this problem you should try to fix it by switching to XA
resources or implementing some form of compensating transactions.
However, if this is not option and you are fully aware of the
consequences you can override this behavior by setting
com.arjuna.ats.jta.allowMultipleLastResources to true in
conf/jbossjta-properties.xml. For more details read the wiki on <a href="http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=Multiple1PC">Multiple1PC</a>,
or consult the <a href="http://labs.jboss.com/jbosstm/docs/index.html">JBoss
Transactions documentation</a>.</li>
<li>A major problem related to the cleaning up of threads after
user transaction timeouts was corrected in <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4481">JBAS-4481</a>.
If you happen to be using User Transactions make sure you follow the <a href="http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=WhatIsTheCorrectPatternForUserTransactions">correct
pattern</a> for committing or rolling them back.</li>
<li>Another serious classloading issue that could lead to a
hanging JBoss with a 100% CPU utilization was fixed with <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4441">JBAS-4441</a>.</li>
</ul><h3>JBossAS 4.2.0.GA</h3>
<ul><li><strong>A JavaSE 5 runtime is </strong><strong>required</strong>
to run JBossAS 4.2. A full
JDK with tools.jar support is no longer needed by jboss, since JBoss
Web packages the eclipse JDT compiler for compiling JSP pages and
javassist has its own internal compiler. JAVA_HOME can point to a JRE, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4161">JBAS-4161</a>.</li>
<li>When compared to previous 4.0.x releases, the various JBoss
APIs should be stable but backwards
compatibility for individual component implementations may not be
guaranteed, e.g. interoperating with another JBoss instance that uses
an older version of JGroups.</li>
<li>Tomcat 6 is now bundled as part of JBoss Web.
deploy/jbossweb-tomcat55.sar has been replaced by
deploy/jboss-web.deployer.</li>
<li>conf/log4j.xml has been renamed to conf/jboss-log4j.xml, to
allow log4j.properties override from scoped deployments, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-1853">JBAS-1853</a>.</li>
<li>log4j and commons-logging have both been upgraded.
commons-logging is patched in addition, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-2823"> JBAS-2823</a>.</li>
<li>Since the latest log4j includes a trace level, there is no
need to reference the custom jboss TRACE level in conf/jboss-log4j.xml
configs, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4163">JBAS-4163</a>.<br>
Instead of: &lt;category
name="org.jboss.system"&gt;&lt;priority value="TRACE"
class="org.jboss.logging.XLevel"/&gt;&lt;/category&gt;<br>
you can use: &lt;category
name="org.jboss.system"&gt;&lt;priority
value="TRACE"/&gt;&lt;/category&gt;</li>
<li>Better integration with WebSphere MQ 5.x, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-3183">JBAS-3183</a>.</li>
<li>The MyFaces JSF implementation has been replaced by the
Glassfish JSF 1.2 one, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-3897">JBAS-3897</a>.</li>
<li>Hibernate, hibernate-annotations and
hibernate-entity-manager have all been upgraded. to v3.2.1.</li>
<li>The default invoker for EJBs has been changed from the
rmi-invoker to the unified-invoker, provided by JBoss Remoting, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-3950">JBAS-3950</a>.</li>
<li>Apache commons http-client and apache-codec were removed
from jbossall-client.jar, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4365"> JBAS-4365</a>.</li>
<li>The address that is stored in the host portion of the RMI
codebase URL can now be set correctly,<a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-3325"> JBAS-3325</a>.</li>
<li>The java2ClassLoadingCompliance setting in jboss-web.xml
was ignored; this has been fixed, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-3047"> JBAS-3047</a>.</li>
<li>In JBoss 4.2 the unified invokers based on JBoss Remoting
are the default transport for accessing EJBs. Using the unified
invokers JBoss 4.2 can interoperate safely with JBoss AS
4.0.4.GA/4.0.5.GA, using the flag
-Djboss.remoting.pre_2_0_compatible=true on the JBoss 4.2.x side. For
interoperating with older JBoss AS versions (3.2.8.SP1 to 4.0.3.SP1)
the legacy rmi or pooled invokers need to be used. See <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4407">JBAS-4407</a>
and the wiki page on <a href="http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=JBossVersionCompatibilityMatrix">
JBoss Version Compatibility</a>.</li>
</ul><!-- ======================================================= --><h2><a name="Configuration">Configuration
Issues</a></h2>
This lists the changes that could affect configuration.<br>
<h3>JBossAS 4.2.3.GA</h3><ul><li>JBossAS
4.2.3.GA can be compiled with both Java5 &amp; Java6. The Java5
compiled binary is our primary/recommended binary distribution. It has
undergone rigorous testing and can run under both a Java 5 and a Java 6
runtime. When running under Java 6 you need to manually copy the
following libraries from the JBOSS_HOME/client directory to the
JBOSS_HOME/lib/endorsed directory, so that the JAX-WS 2.0 apis
supported by JBossWS are used:</li><ul><li>jboss-jaxrpc.jar</li><li>jboss-jaxws.jar</li><li>jboss-jaxws-ext.jar</li><li>jboss-saaj.jar</li><li>jaxb-api.jar</li></ul><li>If
you still have problems using JBoss with a Sun Java 6
runtime,&nbsp;you may want to set&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">-Dsun.lang.ClassLoader.allowArraySyntax=true</span>,
as described in <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4491">JBAS-4491</a>.
Other potential problems under a Java 6 runtime include:</li><ul><li>ORB
getting prematurely destroyed when using Sun JDK 6 (see Sun Bug ID: <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do;jsessionid=fd40a0e2c4c9b79adab12ca088bd?bug_id=6520484">6520484)</a></li><li>Unimplemented
methods in Hibernate for JDK6 interfaces.</li></ul><li>When&nbsp;JBossAS
4.2.3 is compiled with Java 6, support for the extended JDBC 4 API is
included in the binary, however this can only be used&nbsp;under a
Java 6 runtime. In this case no manual configuration steps are
necessary. It should be noted however that the Java 6 compiled
distribution of JBoss AS 4.2.3.GA is still in experimental stage.</li></ul><h3>JBossAS
4.2.2.GA</h3><ul><li>Extensions to
LdapExtLoginModule, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4619">JBAS-4619</a>.</li><li>Escape
syntax for mysql and postgresql in jboss CMP,<a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4463"> JBAS-4463</a>.</li><li>Introduced
a new system
property org.jboss.mx.loading.UnifiedLoaderRepository.notifyMode to
provide fine-grained control over the emission of notifications
whenever&nbsp;Unified Classloaders are created. Classloader leaks
can
appear if those notifications are send to remote jmx agents, so the
usage of the flag can avoid this problem,&nbsp;<a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4593">JBAS-4953</a>.
</li></ul><h3>JBossAS 4.2.1.GA</h3>
<ul><li>%PATH% is not removed from java.library.path in the
presence of JAVA_HOME/bin/native, so e.g. native jdbc drivers can be
loaded, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4418">JBAS-4418</a>.</li>
</ul><h3>JBossAS 4.2.0.GA
</h3><ul><li>JBossAS now binds its services to
localhost (127.0.0.1) *by
default*, instead of binding to all available interfaces (0.0.0.0).
This was primarily done for security reasons because of concerns of
users going to production without having s<a href="http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=SecureJBoss">ecured
their servers properly</a>.
To enable remote access by binding
JBoss services to a particular interface, simply run jboss with the -b
option. To bind to all available interfaces and re-enable the legacy
behaviour use -b 0.0.0.0. In any case,&nbsp;be aware you still need
to <a href="http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=SecureJBoss">secure
you server properly</a>.</li>
<li>There now distinct properties to configure the various
mcast ports, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4021">JBAS-4021</a>.</li>
<li>When running under Linux, run.sh forces the use of IPv4,
due to a jdk bug, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4332">JBAS-4332</a>.</li>
<li>JBoss EJB3 is now included by default. If you don't
need/want EJB3 support, simply remove deploy/ejb3.deployer.</li>
<li>When using native libraries for JBoss Web store them in
JBOSS_HOME/bin/native, which is automatically included in the
classpath, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4162">JBAS-4162</a>.</li>
<li>JBoss Transactions is the new default transaction manager
in JBoss. It is configured in conf/jboss-service.xml and has additional
properties defined in conf/jbossjta-properties.xml. The transaction log
is stored by default at server/default/data/tx-object-store.</li>
<li>If you are on Red Hat Linux, check out the changes in
bin/jboss_init_redhat.sh, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4041">JBAS-4041</a>.</li>
<li>The JBossAS distributions usually include the installer
(.jar), the sources (.tar.gz) and the canonical binary release (.zip).
Unzipping the binary distribution (.zip) with a native unzip utility
will restore correctly the executable permission in the /bin/*.sh
files. However, unzipping using the JDK jar utility ignores the
executable bit, so this need to be set manually.</li>
<li>bin/shutdown.sh no longer sources run.conf, <a href="http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JBAS-4155">JBAS-4155</a>.</li>
